# Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm glad you made it.

Check out some of the repos I am working on, specifically:
- [EVSim](https://github.com/skrukwa/evsim)
- [Informapple](https://github.com/skrukwa/informapple)

Otherwise, please enjoy my completely **subjective** tier list of popular[^1] programming languages below!
[^1]: Roughly based on the IEEE Spectrum Top Programming Languages report.

## Rationale

| Language | Thoughts |
| --- | --- |
| C          | The gold standard of systems programming. Small, portable, and timeless. Gives you just enough abstraction to write serious software, but not enough to forget you're talking to the machine. |
| SQL        | 	Rock-solid and ubiquitous. Comes in many dialects (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc) although it would be nice if they all implemented the ISO/IEC standard as a baseline. And by the way, its “ess-cue-el", not “sequel”! |
| Go         | 	A nearly perfect middle ground between C and Python with beautiful concurrency. The type system is almost perfect (implicit interfaces are a counter example), and the lack of bloat is refreshing (missing hash sets is a counter example). |
| C++        | Not as elegant as C, but possibly more functional for the average project where performance and a low(ish) level control is required. |
| Bash       | Tried and true. For what it is (a UNIX scripting language), it does its job well. Syntax can be clunky and dynamic scope quirks can come up. |
| TypeScript | Wat. If you don't get the reference, Google it. Apparently JavaScript was written in 10 days, and it shows. Although JavaScript's event loop is great, and we have types now. |
| Python     | Amazing package ecosystem but 2 gripes: performance and dynamic typing. Performance has improved steadily through new releases, and is rarely a bottleneck for Python's usual use cases (not to mention interesting developments like PyPy). Type hints introduced in PEP 484 are nice, although not widely adopted, and not enforced during runtime. |
| Java       | I can appreciate the object oriented design choices and clarity the code can convey. At the same time, legacy oddities appear far too often. JVM is overrated, GraalVM looks interesting.  |
| Haskell    | Pure functions, lazy evaluation, and a strong type system. Elegant once mastered. There is a place for this language - somewhere... |
| HTML       | Decent markup language. Does it bring delight to my face? No. Does it work? Yep. |
| CSS        | It works eventually. |
| JavaScript | The only reason you would use this is if you are too lazy to set up TypeScript. |
| R          | Statistical duct tape. Great at doing exactly what it's meant for, and borderline unusable outside of that. |


> [!NOTE]
> As with others, Rust is a language that I have not had a chance to meaningfully explore but that piques my interest, especially given my love for C and the ongoing Rust for Linux discussions.
> Expect an update on this tier list in the near future.
